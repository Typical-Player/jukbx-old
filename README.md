# JUKBX

This is an archive of JUKBX, a music app I was developing from late-2023 to 2024.
Note that on build there are many unused functions because I apparently started to rewrite the app before making a copy of the source code, I had to modify some files to get the app working again (thankfully I just needed to change some function names and some structs)
While the app should work, expect incomplete features.

## FEATURES (or at least the ones that I got to finish)

- LRC reader
- Fast search
- A lot of UI animations (I really like AnimeJS)
- Songs queue
- Small view for the music player
- Basic music visualizer

## BUILD

Follow Tauri's V1 get started guide [[link](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)] and run 'npm run tauri build' ('npm run tauri dev' is you want a debug build)
